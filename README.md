# Overview

Peter Norvig created JScheme, a Lisp Scheme dialect written in Java. It was created in 1998 and it has since been forked, extended and used quite extensively in other modern projects for the web and elsewhere. I mention JScheme because the code I am about present is all based on the JScheme interpreter. The code is copyrighted to Peter Norvig (including the picture of him above), I have only made modifications to make our Lisp even lighter than it was originally. Norvig's most recent implementation of JScheme contains 1905 lines of Java code.
